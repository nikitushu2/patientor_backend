This is a TypeScript-based backend for a medical application called "Patientor". It's a RESTful API built with Express that manages patient health records and medical diagnoses. The application allows for storing, retrieving, and manipulating patient data including personal information (name, date of birth, SSN, gender, occupation) and medical entries (hospital visits, health checks, occupational healthcare visits). The API provides endpoints to fetch all patients, get individual patient details, add new patients, and add medical entries to existing patient records. It uses Zod for data validation and implements proper type safety with TypeScript.
